# A-project-on-Rain-Predication-using-Classfiaction-Algorithm-s-
The area of study is Australia, which keep a record of the amount of rainfall received. The data have been collected from the Kaggle of past 10 years of data of Australia.
 in this project iam using the machine learning classification algorithms [K-Nearst neighbors, Navie bayes , Decision  tree] to predcit the accuracy and i get a good accuray .
  if you want source code go through the files i upolded.
   





if you find any difficulty to download the provied waether dataset,u can go to the kaggle website and serach for rainfall dataset and do this classfication algorithms on those datasets 


thanks for coming
